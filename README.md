### A Mac Keylayout to have direct access to numbers (without pressing shift key)

To install it simply copy the "French Direct Numbers.keylayout" file in /System/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ directory.
```
REPO=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akram/french-direct-numbers-keylayout/master/
wget $REPO/FrenchDirectNumbers.keylayout 
wget $REPO/FrenchDirectNumbers.icns
sudo cp FrenchDirectNumbers.*  /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
```


Then restart your finder (Force quit, then Relaunch on Finder process).

Then go to Keyboard menu in System preference pane and add "French #" as the keyboard layouts list. It should be located in the region name "Others".


Et voil√† !!!!!
